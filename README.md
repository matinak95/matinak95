I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the ECE Department of the University of Southern California (USC), Los Angeles, CA. 
I work as a Graduate Researcher at the USC Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) group under the supervision of Prof. Eun Sok Kim. I am just about to complete my second M.Sc. degrees in Computer Science (CS) at the Viterbi School of Engineering of USC where I earned my first M.Sc. degree back in 2020 in Electrical and Computer Engineering both during my Ph.D. program. Before I start my graduate program at USC, I took my BSc degree from the Electrical Engineering department of Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran.

My research areas mainly focus on smart sensors design and implementation, applications for low-power wireless embedded DSP modules, machine learning solutions for sensors, low-power sensing, and AI in Healthcare.

Here is my [CV](Matin_Barekatain_CV.pdf).
