I am a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Ming Hsieh Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) Department of the University of Southern California (USC), Los Angeles, CA. 
I work as a Graduate Researcher at the USC Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) group under the supervision of Prof. Eun Sok Kim. I completed both my M.Sc. degrees in Computer Science (CS) and ECE at the Viterbi School of Engineering of USC during my Ph.D. program. I earned my B.Sc. degree from the Electrical Engineering department of Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran.

My research areas mainly focus on smart sensors design and implementation, applications for low-power wireless embedded DSP modules, machine learning solutions for wearable systems, piezo and pyroelectric sensing, and AI in Healthcare. My works as a graduate researcher resulted in 5 peer-reviewed papers in top-notch scientific journals and conferences in the field of micro-electronics and solid state devices.

Here is my [CV](Matin_Barekatain_CV.pdf).
